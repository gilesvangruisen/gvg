            <h2>Luff for iPhone</h2>
            <p class="description">I designed and built Luff for iPhone as a way to teach myself Swift and play with iOS 8â€™s new camera APIs. I wanted a simple manual photography app with sliders that allow the user to get just the right exposure, focus, ISO, and zoom. To do this, I implemented a custom slider that adjusts becomes more or less sensitive depending on the distance between the user's finger and the slider.</p>

            <h2>Thready for iPhone</h2>
            <p class="description">I worked with another designer and personally led development of Thready for iPhone. Thready is a private discussion platform that lets small groups communicate with ease. I helped architect and implement a framework as well as a thin caching layer to interact with the Node server. Combining this with the MVVM powered card system (h/t ReactiveCocoa) resulted in a robust, snappy communication app.</p>

            <h2>Fetchnotes for iPhone</h2>
            <p class="description">I helped design and build Fetchnotes for iPhone, a dead simple note-taking app that uses hashtags for organization and @tags for sharing. Because it's a hybrid app (built on Trigger.io), a lot of my work included writing modules to expose native iOS APIs to the AngularJS app in order to provide additional functionality and an overall better experience for our users.</p>

            <h2>Peddler Co.</h2>
            <p class="description">I designed and prototyped a mobile e-commerce solution with a focus on fashion and apparel. Peddler lets users browse apparel and accessories, learning each person's taste from a stream of likes and dislikes. I learned a lot about app architecture and custom UI while building the native iOS interface to a Rails-powered backend.</p>
